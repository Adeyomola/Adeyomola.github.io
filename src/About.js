          I'm a DevOps Engineer driven by the will to conquer yesterday. So, if
          there's a problem I cannot solve today, I'll solve it tomorrow or get
          closer to a solution.
          <br></br>
          When I'm not doing Software Engineering, I'm a Pharmacist, a Writer,
          and i++ other things. I get tired sometimes, and when I do, you'll
          find me with my face buried in something comical. &#128523;
