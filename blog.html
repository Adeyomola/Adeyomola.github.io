        <h1>Asynchronous JavaScript and Callbacks - a Simple Summary</h1>
        <p>Asynchronous codes are basically codes that do not complete their execution according to the regular flow of
            the
            code
            blocks in a script. In other words, the code blocks that come after an asynchronous code may complete their
            execution
            before the asynchronous code.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
            So, What Is the Big Deal With Asynchronous Codes?
        </h2>
        <p>
            The following is an example of a regular script (one without asynchronous codes):
        </p>
        <img src="./images/Image 1.png" alt="">
        <p>
            As you can see, the codes in the script above are executed according to the way they are called. But if we
            have
            an
            asynchronous code, like the XMLHttpRequest() below, the code blocks in the script will not be executed in
            the
            order they
            are called.
            See below:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/Image 2.png" alt="">
        <p>
            As said before, asynchronous codes do not follow the regular flow of the program or script. So, any code
            that
            needs a
            value from the asynchronous code for its own execution will not work as it should.
            If a code needs a value from the asynchronous code in your script, the code could either:
            <li>Wait for the complete execution of the asynchronous code before it completes its own execution.</li>
            <li>Throw an error.</li>
            To avoid a situation where a code throws an error because it depends on an asynchronous code, callbacks are
            added to
            asynchronous codes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Callbacks</h2>
        <p>Callbacks are functions used as arguments in another function. They offer some control over the sequence in
            which
            the
            codes in a script are executed.
            By adding a code as a callback to an asynchronous function(asynchronous code), you ensure that such code
            will
            only
            execute when the asynchronous function completes its execution. This way, the code will only be initiated
            when
            it gets a
            value from the asynchronous function. Hence, it will not throw an error.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If we include callbacks to the asynchronous script above, we will get the following:
        </p>
        <img src="./images/Image 3.png" alt="">
        <p>
            By making them callbacks, the two functions that need a value from the asynchronous function will not throw
            an
            error.
            Being callbacks in the asynchronous function, they are compelled to wait for the asynchronous function
            before
            they
            execute.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>
            Summary
        </h2>
        <p>
            Normally, JavaScript codes execute in the order in which you call them. However, an asynchronous code will
            not follow
            this regular flow. This means an asynchronous code will most likely execute later than a code you called
            after it.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the execution of a code called after an asynchronous code is dependent on the value returned by the
            asynchronous
            code, it may throw an error. To avoid this, such codes are added to the asynchronous functions (asynchronous
            codes) as
            callbacks.
